## üìç Overview

The nextjs-wordpress-blog project is a JavaScript application built with the Next.js framework and TypeScript, and it is configured with various tools for professional development.

This includes Tailwind CSS and PostCSS for styling and cross-browser compatibility.

The main application is a blog that fetches data from a WordPress API and displays it in a modern and responsive layout.

Next.js SSR (Server-Side Rendering) is used to improve SEO and performance.

Designs are simple and clean, with a focus on readability and user experience.

All WordPress API requests are centralized in the `@/lib/api.ts` file, and the application is organized into components and pages.

Post, User, and Media interfaces are defined in the `@/interfaces` folder, containing only the necessary fields for the application.
